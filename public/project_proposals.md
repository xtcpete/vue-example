# Project Proposals

For the project proposals, prepare a Google Slides document that you will share with the instructors. Name the document based on the number in the sign-up sheet, e.g., `dsci-554-project-proposal-team-1`. The proposal should include the following key elements to clearly outline the objectives, datasets, methods, and expected outcomes of the project.

## Slide 1: Cover Slide

- **Project title**: This can be temporary.
- **Team name**: This can be temporary.
- **List of team members**: Include names and emails.

## Slide 2: Introduction

- Define the specific problem or topic your project aims to address and describe what you wish to build.
- Explain why this is important. Highlight the potential impact or significance of your project.

## Slide 3: Goal and Story

- Explain the main goal of the project.
- Identify the end user. Think about stakeholders or specific user groups (e.g., data analysts, the general public, decision-makers).
- Discuss potential use cases for your project.
- If you decide to build an infographic, what story are you telling?

## Slide 4: Previous and Existing Work

- Research existing work related to your interests. Summarize what others have done that is similar to your project.
- Discuss how your project will differ from or improve upon what already exists.

## Slide 5: Datasets

- Explain where the data comes from. (Refer to `project_resources.md` for examples.)
- Provide an initial understanding of the data, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Identify potential issues (e.g., missing values, outliers) and describe your plan for data wrangling and preparation.

## Slide 6: Design Considerations

- Explain what others have done in terms of graphic forms, colors, layouts, and interactivity.
- Discuss your design plan, including graphic forms, colors, chart types, and interactivity. Keep accessibility in mind (e.g., colorblind-friendly designs).
- You can use wireframes to help explain your design ideas.

## Slide 7: Tools

- List the tools you plan on using (e.g., Python, R, Flask, matplotlib, pandas).
- Explain how these tools are suitable for your project, highlighting their usefulness in handling data and building interactive visualizations.

## Slide 8: Timeline

- Create a project timeline with milestones to track your progress.

## Slide 9: Team

- Explain how each team member will contribute to different aspects of the project.
- Describe how your team will collaborate and communicate. Using Git for version control is required.
